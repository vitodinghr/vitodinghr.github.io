## Project Overview

The Virtual Event Platform enables organizations to host engaging online events with features like live streaming, interactive workshops, and networking opportunities. It provides comprehensive analytics and management tools for event organizers.

## Technical Implementation

The platform utilizes React for the frontend, WebRTC for video streaming, and Socket.io for real-time communications. PostgreSQL handles structured data while Redis manages real-time features and caching.
