		question: "Who are the themes for?",
		answer: `These themes are for developers who want to have pre-created templates to use in their projects,
    and have the hard stuff taken care of. Whether that is personal projects, a new SaaS business, a website for a client, etc.
    They offer speed, customizability with swappable 
    components, built-in SEO, and image optimization. Instead of spending hours figuring out 
    how to do this yourself, you can leverage the themes to save weeks of time and effort. You can easily 
    mix and match sections, update the copy, and change site colors with CSS variables, and more.`,
	},
	{
		question: "What all components are included?",
		answer: `100+ components. Including 3 hero sections, 2 logo clouds, 2 about sections, 2 project showcase sections, 
    2 process sections, 3 pricing sections, 2 testimonial sections, 2 blog showcase sections, 2 faq sections, 2 contact sections.
    Plus layouts for projects, blog posts, resume, and additional pages like legal and 404. And a cookie banner for good measure.`,
	},
	{
		question: 'What do you mean by "free updates"?',
		answer: `When you purchase any of our themes, you get lifetime updates for free. 
      We regularly update our themes to ensure compatibility with the latest version of Astro, 
      and to add new features or bug fixes.`,
	},
	{
		question: "Why Astro?",
		answer: `Astro is an excellent framework for content-focused websites, with a great developer
      experience. It also allows you to use any UI framework you want within it, such as React, Vue,
      and Svelte. This means you can use any of your existing components, or any of the thousands of 
      components available online. `,
	},
	{
		question: "Can I use a theme for multiple projects?",
		answer: `Yes, you can use any of our themes for as many projects as you like.
      You can even sell websites you create with them to your clients. As long as you
      don't resell the theme itself, you're likely to go! See our
      <a href="https://cosmicthemes.com/license/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">License</a> 
      page for more details.`,
	},
	{
		question: "How do I get new versions of the themes?",
		answer: `You can get the newest version of themes from the Cosmic Themes github organization, 
    as well as from Polar.sh, for all themes you have access to.`,
	},
